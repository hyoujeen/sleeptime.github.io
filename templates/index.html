      College students often find themselves overwhelmed by their
      <br/>
      schedules: classes, projects, deadlines. It’s easy to forget the essentials. Students skip meals and don’t prioritize
      <br/>
      the most important thing: their health.  
      <br/>
      getYour$h*tTogether is a planner designed for college students, by college students. We realize that
